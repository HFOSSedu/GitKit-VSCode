  <title>Forking the Upstream Repository</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="topic-basic-foss-workflow" /> you saw how FOSS communities can use a basic workflow to collaborate. In this section you will begin to gain hands-on experience with that workflow. <xref ref="fig-basic-workflow-fork"/> illustrates first step in the workflow. In this step you will <term>fork</term> the main project repository, which creates a copy of it into your own GitHub space.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that when working on the GitKit you will not actually be interacting with the main FarmData2 repository. Instead, you will be interacting with a copy of the FarmData2 repository that was created just for these activities. That said, you will be treating this copy exactly as if it is the “Main Project Repo” or the upstream repository.  This allows you, your classmates and many other students to practice interacting with an upstream project for learning purposes without affecting the main FarmData2 repository.

          Notice that in <xref ref="fig-basic-workflow-fork" /> there is an dashed orange arrow pointing from your remote copy (i.e. your origin) to the main project repo (i.e. the upstream). This arrow is indicating that your fork knows where the upstream project repository is located.
