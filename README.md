## Updating this Edition

**Do not edit this repository.**

If changes are to be made to the GitKit text, including any changes that are edition specific, they should be made in the [GitKit-Text](https://github.com/HFOSSedu/GitKit-Text) repository.

Once the edits have been made, this repository can be updated to include those changes as follows:
1. Open the [GitKit-VSCode Branches](https://github.com/HFOSSedu/GitKit-VSCode/branches) page.
2. Create a new Pull Request to merge the `VSCode-Edition-Changes` branch into the `main` branch of the [GitKit-VSCode](https://github.com/HFOSSedu/GitKit-VSCode) repository.
   - **BE CAREFUL HERE**
     - By default PR will go to the `main` branch of the [GitKit-Text](https://github.com/HFOSSedu/GitKit-Text) repository. But we need it to go to the `main` branch of the [GitKit-VSCode](https://github.com/HFOSSedu/GitKit-VSCode) repository.
     - To do this, change the `base repository` to be the [GitKit-VSCode](https://github.com/HFOSSedu/GitKit-VSCode).
3. Open the main [GitKit-VSCode](https://github.com/HFOSSedu/GitKit-VSCode) repository page.
4. Click the "Synch fork" button.
5. Click the "Discard x commits" button (where x will be some number).
6. Merge the PR that you created in step 2.
